Just some testing, getting coveralls working a little..
Trying to get some CI going..

This tests codecov reporting. It should run Travis CI on each commit,
then run coverage, and output the results to codecov and the PR itself.

Also adds the coverage % and the build status to the repo homepage. 
Looks like it is working
